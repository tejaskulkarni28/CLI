# This project I am building for practice and for fun to understand the fundamentals of GoLang to get hands on practice 

    -> Created a new branch called development.
    -> Created a new file called main.go as a standard naming 
    -> Created a new file called go.mod to manage all the dependencies (using go mod init, go tidy init: really don't know what is go tidy for now! Saddd)
